We have created a blockchain application using Chakra UI and Next js, a frontend framework using javascript. The 
application runs on a localhost server, the user logs in using their wallet. The user friendly dashboard displays the user 
information regarding:

* Balance in the metamask wallet
* Transactions 
* NFTs or tokens

It also allows sending ETH to a specified address.

Instructions/ steps followed:

1. Download the below softwares:

	> Metamask
	> Ganache
	> Visual Studio Code
	> Node.js (LTS version)-from the link:
